# TypeScript Learning Journal

Welcome to my **TypeScript Journey**!

Here I document my daily progress as I learn and apply **TypeScript** fundamentals, best practices, and advanced concepts. This journal helps me stay consistent, track what I've learned, and build confidence in writing type-safe JavaScript code.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this TypeScript journey, you should have:

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Basic understanding of variables, functions, objects, arrays, and ES6+ features
- **Node.js**: Basic familiarity with Node.js and npm (for running TypeScript)
- **Code Editor**: VS Code or similar with TypeScript support
- **Terminal/Command Line**: Comfort with basic commands

If you need a JavaScript refresher, check out [this JS repo](https://github.com/kushkumarkashyap7280/JAVASCRIPT).

---

## Why?

Because TypeScript:

- Catches bugs early ⚠️
- Makes large projects easier to manage 🏗️
- Is widely adopted in modern web development 💼

This repo is my learning companion to understand and master TypeScript step-by-step.

---

## How It Works

- Learn a new topic every day
- Document it in a dedicated folder
- Push notes, examples, and projects
- Review and build from past learnings

---

## Structure

```
typescript-learning/
├── Day 01 - Types & Setup /
│   └── README.md, index.ts
├── Day 02 - Functions & Objects /
│   └── README.md, functions.ts
├── Day 03 - Arrays, Tuples, Enums /
│   └── README.md, arrays.ts
├── Projects - Practice /
│   └── avg-function.ts
└── README.md ← You are here
```

Each folder includes:

- Topics learned
- Code examples
- Key takeaways
- Challenges or mini-projects

---

## 📅 Daily Progress

### Day 1 – Types & Setup

- **Topics:** TypeScript installation, type annotations, primitive types (number, string, boolean, bigint, any, unknown), function basics, type inference, optional/default parameters, and tsconfig basics.
- **Folder:** [Day 01 - Types & Setup](day_001/)
- **Deep Dive:** [day_001/README.md](day_001/README.md)
- **Code:** [day_001/index.ts](day_001/index.ts)

## 🌟 Goals

- ✅ Become confident writing modern TypeScript
- ✅ Convert small JS utilities and React components to TS
- ✅ Apply TS in backend with Node.js and Express
- ✅ Document and share my learning consistently

---

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
npx tsc

# Run (Node.js backend example)
node dist/filename.js
```
